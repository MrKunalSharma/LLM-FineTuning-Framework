{"instruction": "Summarize the following text", "input": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.", "output": "Machine learning is an AI subset where computers learn from data using algorithms and statistical models without explicit programming."}
{"instruction": "Translate to French", "input": "Hello, how are you today?", "output": "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?"}
{"instruction": "Write a Python function to calculate factorial", "input": "", "output": "def factorial(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return 1\n    return n * factorial(n - 1)"}
{"instruction": "Explain quantum computing in simple terms", "input": "", "output": "Quantum computing uses quantum bits (qubits) that can exist in multiple states simultaneously, unlike classical bits that are either 0 or 1. This allows quantum computers to process many calculations at once, potentially solving certain complex problems much faster than traditional computers."}
{"instruction": "What are the benefits of exercise?", "input": "", "output": "Exercise provides numerous benefits including improved cardiovascular health, stronger muscles and bones, better mental health, weight management, increased energy levels, better sleep quality, and reduced risk of chronic diseases."}
